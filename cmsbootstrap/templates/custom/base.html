{% extends "cmsbootstrap/base.html" %}

{% comment %}
The presence of this file allows other templates to extend custom/base.html,
and you can replace this file using your own apps to add features to
cmsbootstrap/base.html and have them available in all the default templates
(cmsbootstrap/page_3col_notitle.html and friends).
